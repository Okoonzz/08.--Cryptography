1. Compile Openssl using mingw64 (run on mingw64 terminal)
- Check for sure that only one make program in your computer: where make 
the return should be one path to make.exe

./Configure CC="/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe" CXX="/mingw64/bin/g++.exe" --prefix="C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Openssl"
make clean
make -j 12
(optinal make test -j 12)
make install -j 12
notes:
--prefix: location for install (copy) after compiling
-j <number>: the number CPU threads for parallel processing
